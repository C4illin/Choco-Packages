#### Based on libmpv

mpv.net is based on libmpv which offers a straightforward C API that was designed from the ground up to make mpv usable as a library and facilitate easy integration into other applications. mpv is like vlc not based on DirectShow or Media Foundation. 

#### Command Line Interface

mpv.net has the [CLI of mpv](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options).

#### High quality video output

libmpv has an OpenGL based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, HDR, and more.

#### On Screen Controller

The OSC of libmpv offers play controls with a modern flat design. ([Screenshot](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net#main-window-screenshot))

#### GPU video decoding

libmpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support DXVA2 video decoding acceleration.
